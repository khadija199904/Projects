## Overview

This repository demonstrates my work in data science and machine learning, utilizing various algorithms and techniques such as regression, classification, clustering, NLP, and neural networks. Each project folder includes a detailed breakdown of the problem statement, data preprocessing steps, model building, evaluation, and results.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you need the following:
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or any IDE (VS Code.)
- Required Python libraries

## Project List
## 1. Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Description:
This project aims to classify sentiments (positive, negative, neutral, Irrelevant) from Twitter data. It uses either Logistic Regression or Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB) with Bag of Words (BoW) or TF-IDF for text vectorization to analyze the sentiment expressed in tweets.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is available at Kaggle: Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis.

Dataset Content: The dataset consists of tweets labeled by sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), and contains the following fields:
 id: The unique identifier for the tweet.
entity: The entity or topic in the tweet.
sentiment: The sentiment label (positive, negative, neutral).
text: The text of the tweet.

Key Features:

Preprocesses tweets (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
Uses either Bag of Words (BoW) or TF-IDF to transform text data into numerical vectors.
Visualizes results with charts, word clouds, and pie charts for sentiment distribution.
Provides two classification models: Logistic Regression and BernoulliNB.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix.
Tools and Libraries: pandas, numpy, nltk, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
